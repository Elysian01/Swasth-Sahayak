## Project Structure

1. Frontend Application
   1. [Health Worker Application](./health-worker-app)
   2. [Doctor Web Application](./doctor-web-app)
   3. [Supervisor Admin Web Application](./supervisor-admin-web-app)
2. Backend (common server for all frontend applications)
   1. [Server](./server)
  
## Major Challenge Encountered

1. Multilingual Integration:
2. Tablet App working in offline mode
3. System Design for hospital, doctor, health-worker, patient management
4. Switch between systems design and app design, there were cases where we were designing app for system instead of designing  system first and then the required application (like we imagined ideal scenario of data upload (upload in chunks is the solution))

## Assumptions
